A comprehensive machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements using supervised learning techniques.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements a classification model to identify iris flower species:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor** 
- **Virginica**

The classification is based on four key features:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- ✅ Understand basic classification problems
- ✅ Explore and visualize datasets effectively  
- ✅ Implement machine learning algorithms (KNN & Decision Tree)
- ✅ Evaluate model performance using multiple metrics
- ✅ Gain hands-on experience with the complete ML pipeline

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** - Machine learning algorithms and metrics
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Development environment

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository (via sklearn.datasets)
- **Samples**: 150 total (50 per species)
- **Features**: 4 numerical features
- **Target**: 3 classes (species)
- **Missing Values**: None
